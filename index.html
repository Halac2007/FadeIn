                  <h2 class="title center">Almost any event can be meaningfully summarised with a timeline.</h2>
                  <p>
                    Time, like an arrow, tends to travel in only one direction. There are, however, many ways to represent the passage
                    of time (and in Shorthand it's possible to step backwards through time, too). Let's take a look at just a few
                    possibilities of representing events through time here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Consider this template not an example of a single story, but as a showcase of techniques for achieving a single
                    outcome: a timeline.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shorthand sections can be used individually or in combination for the presentation of timeline, and depending on
                    your content and intent, one method may be more suitable than another. In any instance it's up to you how to style
                    the line (if there is one), the individual points or segments of the line, and how accurately you wish to portray
                    different lengths of time or importance of the elements.
                  </p>
                  <p>Let's get to some examples.</p>
                  <hr aria-hidden="true" class="divider background" />
                  <h2 class="title center">A <em>Scrollmation</em> section</h2>
                  <p>
                    A Scrollmation section includes one column for text and one for a sequence of images (on narrow screens, the top
                    portion of the screen will show the image sequence while the text scrolls beneath).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With multiple image frames and slight changes between them, it is relatively easy to add some animation to your
                    explanation. Changes could include highlights, dates, size increases or more.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Here's a Scrollmation timeline:</strong></p>

            <span class="first-char color-ny">B</span>reaking into the New York fashion world is no easy task. But by the early 2000's,
            UGG Australia began to take it by storm. The evolution of UGG from a brand that made sheepskin boots, slippers, clogs and
            sandals for an active, outdoor lifestyle to a brand that was now being touted as a symbol of a stylish, casual and luxurious
            lifestyle was swift. Much of this was due to a brand repositioning effort that transformed UGG into a high-end luxury
            footwear maker. As a fashion brand, UGG advertisements now graced the pages of Vogue Magazine as well as other fashion books.
            In the mid 2000's, the desire for premium casual fashion was popping up all over the world and UGG was now perfectly aligned
            with this movement.

          <p class="line-break margin-top-10 fade-in"></p>
          <p class="margin-top-10 fade-in">
            Fueled by celebrities from coast to coast wearing UGG boots and slippers on their downtime, an entirely new era of fashion
            was carved out. As a result, the desire and love for UGG increased as people wanted to go deeper into this relaxed UGG
            experience. UGG began offering numerous color and style variations on their sheepskin boots and slippers. Cold weather boots
            for women and men and leather casuals were added with great success. What started as a niche item, UGG sheepskin boots were
            now a must-have staple in everyone's wardrobe. More UGG collections followed, showcasing everything from knit boots to
            sneakers to wedges, all the while maintaining that luxurious feel UGG is known for all over the world. UGG products were now
            seen on runways and in fashion shoots from coast to coast. Before long, the love spread even further.

            the rising demand from new fans, UGG opened flagship stores in the UK and an additional location in Moscow. As the love
            spread farther East, concept stores were opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo. UGG Australia is now an international brand
            that is loved by all. This love is a result of a magical combination of the amazing functional benefits of sheepskin and the
            heightened emotional feeling you get when you slip them on your feet. In short, you just feel better all over when you wear
            UGG boots, slippers, and shoes.

            invite even more men to feel the love the rest of the world knows so well. UGG will also step into the world of high fashion
            with UGG Collection. The UGG Collection fuses the timeless craft of Italian shoemaking with the reliable magic of sheepskin,
            bringing the luxurious feel of UGG to high end fashion. As the love for UGG continues to spread across the world, we have
            continued to offer new and unexpected ways to experience the brand. The UGG journey continues on and the love for UGG
